# Getting Started with React NewsApp
News App is a frontend project that provides latest news in an organised page. News category includes Business, Technology, Health, Science, Sports and Entertainment.

## API
News API [https://newsapi.org/]

## Deployment
Because News API asked for updates when deployed in Vercel, I don't have a deployed version. So can simply create your own API key, insert in .env.local file and pull the project.
